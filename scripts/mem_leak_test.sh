# tcap memory-leak regression test.
#
# Builds and runs the `leak_check` example, which installs a counting global
# allocator and asserts that live bytes (allocated − freed) stay flat across
# repeated TCAP encode/decode round-trips. Exits non-zero (and prints FAIL) on a
# leak.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/mem_leak_test.sh
